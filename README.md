The Patient-Led Assessments of the Care Environment (PLACE) programme replaced the former Patient Environment Action Team (PEAT) programme from April 2013. These self-assessments are undertaken by teams of NHS and private/independent health care providers, and, for the first time, include at least 50 per cent members of the public (known as patient assessors). They focus on the environment in which care is provided, as well as supporting non-clinical services such as cleanliness, food, hydration, and the extent to which the provision of care with privacy and dignity is supported.

The ERIC (Estates Return Information Collection) is collected and published here by the HSCIC on behalf of the Department of Health. It is the main central data collection for estates and facilities services from the NHS containing information dating back to 1999/2000 and will be added to as future returns are completed. The data provided enables the analysis of Estates & Facilities information from NHS Trusts and PCTs in England which is a compulsory requirement that NHS Trusts submit an Estates Return. The data is as provided by reporting organisations and has not been amended. The accuracy and completeness is the responsibility of the reporting organisations.
